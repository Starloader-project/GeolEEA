# GeolEEA

GeolEEA is a set of Eclipse External Annotations (EEA) that define nullability
of certain methods without being too pedantric with null checks.

GeolEEA was initially meant for private use (hence the name), but I believe
in order to be able to enforce some "standard" means of null checking,
open-sourcing the project is a requirement.

## Contributing

Due to the nature of this set of nullability annotations, I discourage
directly contributing to this repository. Large additions belong in
more mainstream projects and are likely to get denied. However, small additions
(i.e. one or two methods) are likely to get accepted, especially if they relate
with contributions for another repository.
